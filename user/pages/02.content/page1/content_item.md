The mythical unicorn. Once thought of as a legendary creature of infallible purity, the term has since been repurposed by Silicon Valley. 2015 was called the year of the unicorn because of the large number of tech startups that reached the important $1 billion valuation mark during that year. These ‘unicorns’ grew on the back of the heightened interest by investors into young and flashy startup companies. Startups like Uber, Airbnb and Snapchat have been all the rage. Not just among young people, but by investors as well. 

This trend is nothing new, as many of you may recall the dot-com bubble. The culture and ecosystem of Silicon Valley has given these startups an almost mythical aura, hence the term unicorn. With their large coffers, venture capitalists and other investor types pushed tech companies’ valuations higher and higher. Despite these startups’ lack of experience, and even profit, investors poured cash into these firms hand over fist. As more startups reached and even grew past the unicorn mark, some commentators began questioning the trend. 

It has been known since the dot-com era that investors can get ahead of themselves and push tech companies’ valuations higher than is reflected by market principles. It now appears that at least some in the venture community recognize the perils of this behavior and are beginning to make adjustments. But what does this mean for current and potential unicorns? And what does this mean for the ecosystem and culture of Silicon Valley?

The Age of Unicorns… or Unicorpses?

The rationale behind investing in a unicorn is rather straightforward. Say an investor gives a small capital injection to five startups in exchange for preferred shares. Four of them fail while one goes on to become a unicorn. Even if the investor holds a minority stake in the unicorn startup, that minority stake could potentially be worth quite a hefty sum. The data certainty seemed to support this idea, for a time. According to research from the law firm Cooley LLP, the median valuation of Series A capital raisings grew by 135 percent between 2012 and 2014. The following year, the number of private tech companies valued at $1 billion or more surged to 168, a new record according to VC research group CB Insights. Both groups seemed satisfied with this system. Startup founders could receive large sums of money for business operations by appeasing investors. At the same time, venture capitalists could watch their preferred shares skyrocket in value. But there is one major issue with this line of thinking. 

The various startup ecosystems found in Silicon Valley do not often promote profitability. Outside of the tech startup sector, profitability is one of the primary metrics used when evaluating a company and that company’s share price. But the mysticism surrounding tech startups blinded investors and led to a stampede of ill-conceived investments. An arms race of sorts emerged. Startups began racing towards the $1 billion valuation mark, an important psychological barrier according to Stewart Butterfield, the co-founder of Flickr and Slack. “It does make a difference psychologically,” Butterfield said. “One billion is better than $800 million because it’s the psychological threshold for potential customers, employees and the press.” While racing towards this new goal, startups forgot all about profitability, as did investors. The consequences have been drastic. 

The New Unicorns are Really Cockroaches

As revealed by a Fortune Magazine study, the performance of private-equity and venture capital fell over the first quarter of the year. The failure to pay attention to profitability has begun catching up to tech companies, even the unicorns. The desire of venture capitalists and startups to reach a high valuation has “driven irresponsible behavior of founders”, according to Pieter van der Does, the chief executive of Dutch payments firm Adyen. Now a trend trend is emerging in reaction to this lack of profitability.

Rather than unicorns, some investors are now looking for cockroaches. Although darling unicorn startups rise quickly, they fall just as hard. Cockroaches, on the other hand, are built for endurance and stress. Following the year of the unicorn, the volume of VC funds flowing into startups has fallen sharply. According to CB Insights, while Q3 2015 saw 72 mega-financing rounds worth $100 million or more, the following quarter saw a mere 38. At the same time, a multitude of unicorns began issuing cheaper shares out of necessity, sending valuations plummeting. Square, Good Technology and Foursquare are just a few of the companies that have seen their valuation fall by at least half. 

Cockroach startups are about resiliency and weathering the storm, says Restoration Partners director Tim McSweeney. While unicorns seem perfect, it’s really the cockroach that “can survive a nuclear war”. Rather than investing for breakneck growth, experts like McSweeney recommend investing for sustainability. Focusing on growth for the sake of growth alone is unsustainable as it seldom leads to profit. Investors instead are looking for startups that nurture products and services that already exist, rather than focusing on acquiring new customers altogether. 

VCs – Then & Now

The era of fast and loose cash appears to be over, at least to some extent. One of the primary mechanisms driving the old venture capital community was fear. More specifically, the fear of being left out. When investors are in the eye of the storm, it can be difficult to see the storm itself. The tech startup boom from the past few years has been an exciting ride. Investors jumped abroad this ride as to not be left out. But it has become apparent that investing in flash rather than fundamentals is a poor investment strategy. The pullback in VC funding we are seeing now is a shift in perception. 

Impact of VCs

The impact of this now dying trend of free flowing VC capital is more insidious than one might think. There is of course a heightened risk of a stock market bubble associated with excessive and laissez-faire venture capitalism, which by itself is more than enough to warrant skepticism and warning. But on top of these risks, others loom in the background. Economic inequality can be exacerbated by these kinds of trends as well. 

Part of the issue with the unicorn-search style of VC investing comes in two forms. First, the concentration of wealth lies in the hands of just a few of the wealthiest funds. Second, the inflated prestige of unicorn startups pushes demand for employee perks and benefits. The ecosystem of Silicon Valley is constantly trying to create the next Apple or Google. For a potential employee, that means changing jobs frequently in order to latch onto the next major tech company. Startups are then forced to one-up each other in terms of perks and benefits. The lucky few who find themselves at a unicorn see their relative income and position in society increase exponentially compared to others.  

Even worse, many employees – even those at unicorn startups – can find themselves empty handed after just a few short years. In an interview with Business Insider, billionaire Mark Cuban discussed this trend. Cuban noted that most of these companies store their value in private markets. Although employees and founders make gains on paper and enjoy temporarily high salaries, those benefits can dry up overnight. Should the company lose its unicorn status, many of those perceived gains go out the window, and many employees are left with nothing but something to put on their resume. 

What Should We Pay Attention To?

Criticisms of the venture capitalist community are nothing new. Currently a debate is raging over the correct way to measure the value of tech startups. The debate has even reached the highest levels of government. Mary Jo White, the head of the SEC, spoke recently at Stanford University and discussed the perils of unicorn investments. White questioned the true value of supposed unicorns and urged investors to consider market principles such as profitability before investing. But others disagree, including Mark Cuban and Y Combinator president Sam Altman. Cuban criticized White’s comments, accusing the SEC of scare tactics and instead supported the trend of large IPOs. Altman said he found the entire debate to be “dumb” and even went as far to question the legitimacy of private company markdowns and devaluations. As the debate burns on, it is clear that VC funding and the ecosystem of Silicon Valley is contentious and polarizing. It is unfortunately the case that the venture capital ecosystem of Silicon Valley is a double edged sword. While tech companies certainly require startup capital, this necessity can lead to overvaluations, stock market bubbles and a poor environment for employees.
